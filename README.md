# Visualizing Storm Data

This app visualizes storm data from the years 1975 to 2021. We can see the route that each storm takes in each year. We can also apply other filters to change how the storms' paths look based on wind speed or pressure. This app can also filter by major storms only, so we only see category 3 or higher storms. 

To access the web version of the app you can go to the following link: https://andwappe.shinyapps.io/app1/

This app was created using R and the package shiny, as well as tidyverse, sf, and rnaturalearth.

This code is refactored and developed further on from a class project I did in Concepts in Computing with Data.
